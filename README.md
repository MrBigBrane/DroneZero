# DroneZero - A Web Visualization for CO₂ Monitoring UAVs


## Our Mission
Each year, as global CO₂ emissions rise, the seemingly distant worry of climate change becomes increasingly real. To effectively tackle this growing concern, we must first understand the root of the issue: the sources of emissions.

Our product, DroneZero, collects precise CO₂ measurements in both rural and urban areas, providing users access to real-time, relevant data. Once a monitoring session is complete, the data is exported as a CSV file for further geospatial analysis in our user-friendly map visualization, offering immediate insights into CO₂ emissions on a local scale.

<b>But DroneZero is more than just a tool - it's a step towards regaining control over our planet</b>



## 1. Why DroneZero?

### Cost
Problem: The cost of CO₂ monitoring systems is too high (over 250M USD for one satellite) and technological challenges with creating them have caused underdeveloped countries to forgo developing their own CO₂ monitoring network and instead rely on international datasets or local monitoring efforts. restrictions. Commercially available CO₂ monitoring drone systems are also often too expensive to be used in developing countries, being anywhere from $4,000 for research level drones to $10,000+ for commercial level drones.
<br></br>
Our solution: To lower the cost of these systems, we chose to incorporate cost-efficient but reliable components to create our drone. Moreover, unlike satellites, this drone is easy to operate and provides data at a smaller scope, making it more relevant to understanding local emission trends. A fleet of these drones can be used in place of or complement satellite CO₂ monitoring systems.

### Accessibility
Problem: Current CO₂ monitoring systems use satellites which require technical expertise which many countries do not have. According to a 2022 Clean Air Fund survey, about one-third of 119 countries could not establish CO₂ monitoring networks due to financial and technical expertise. Furthermore, satellites are not well equipped for localised monitoring as they have low resolution and cannot provide real-time data.

Our solution: A drone system solves these issues, not requiring as much technical expertise to operate. It can also monitor at any time with an easy and efficient retrieval of the data.

Here is a brief demonstration of a CO₂ monitoring mission:

Looking at the CO₂ column of the CSV file (a data spreadsheet similar to Excel or Google Sheets), we can see the concentration levels and judge whether our environment is safe. Here are the concentration levels to help you judge the safety of your environment:

1. < 1000 ppm: Considered safe for elongated exposure. 
2. 1,000 - 1,500 ppm: Symptoms may begin to appear.
3. 1,500+ ppm: More intense symptoms and possibly health risks.

Since the CO₂ concentrations are between 390 and 480 ppm, we can conclude that our school’s CO₂ levels are healthy ✅!
