## Our Mission
Each year, as global CO₂ emissions rise, the seemingly distant worry of climate change becomes increasingly real. To effectively tackle this growing concern, we must first understand the root of the issue: the sources of emissions.

Our product, DroneZero, collects precise CO₂ measurements in both rural and urban areas, providing users access to real-time, relevant data, with <b>easy public access</b> and <b>low cost</b>. Once a monitoring session is complete, the data is exported as a CSV file for further geospatial analysis in our user-friendly map visualization, offering immediate insights into CO₂ emissions on a local scale.

#### But DroneZero is more than just a tool - it's a step towards regaining control over our planet

## 1. Cost

Problem: The cost of CO2 monitoring systems is too high (over 250M USD for one satellite), and technological challenges with creating CO2 monitoring systems have caused underdeveloped countries to forgo CO2 monitoring systems. According to a 2022 Clean Air Fund survey, about one-third of 119 countries could not establish CO2 monitoring networks due to financial and technical expertise restrictions.
<br></br>
Our solution: To lower the cost of CO2 monitoring systems, we created a low-cost drone that can monitor CO2. This drone is easy to operate and provides accurate data at low cost, and a fleet of these drones can be used in place of the satellite CO2 monitoring systems.

## 2. Accessibility

Problem: Current CO2 monitoring systems use satellites, which require technical expertise that many countries do not have. Furthermore, satellites have low resolution when monitoring CO2 and cannot monitor at exact times of the day due to their orbit pattern.

Our solution: A drone system will solve these issues as it doesn’t require as much technical expertise to operate and can monitor at any time with an easy and efficient retrieval of the data.

Looking at the CO₂ column of the .csv file (A data spreadsheet similar to Excel or Google Spreadsheet), we can see what our concentration levels are and can judge whether we live in a safe environment or not. Here are the concentration levels to help you judge the safety of your environment:

1. 350-450 ppm: Considered normal outdoor air levels. 
2. 400-1,000 ppm: Safe and typical for indoor spaces with good ventilation. 
3. 1,000-2,000 ppm: May cause complaints of drowsiness and poor air quality. 
4. 2,000-5,000 ppm: Can cause headaches, sleepiness, and impaired cognitive function. 
5. 5,000 ppm (and above): Violates OSHA requirements, and prolonged exposure can lead to more serious health effects. 
6. 40,000 ppm and above: Immediately dangerous to life and health, potentially leading to loss of consciousness and death.

With the list above, we can actually judge the safety of our environment from example data collected during one of our flight tests.

Seeing as our CO₂ concentration is in the 450s to low 500s, are school has a healthy environment ✅!
